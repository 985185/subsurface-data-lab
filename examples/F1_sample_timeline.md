# Example Reconstructed Well Timeline (Demonstration Only)

**Well:** F-1  
**Field:** Volve  
**Purpose:** Demonstration of reconstructed operational history

## Section 1 — Surface Hole

**Date:** 12-Jun-2007  
Drilled 26" hole section to 312 m MD using seawater mud. No significant operational issues reported.

**Event types identified:**
- drilling ahead
- connection operations
- circulation

## Section 2 — Intermediate Hole

**Date:** 18-Jun-2007  
Losses encountered while drilling 17½" section at ~820 m MD. LCM pills pumped and circulation restored.

**Event types identified:**
- drilling
- partial losses
- remedial mud treatment

## Casing Operation

**Date:** 21-Jun-2007  
Ran 13⅜" casing to 1012 m MD. Cemented to surface. WOC observed.

**Event types identified:**
- run casing
- cementing
- wait on cement

## Logging

**Date:** 24-Jun-2007  
Wireline logging conducted (gamma ray, resistivity). Hole condition acceptable.

**Event types identified:**
- wireline logging
- hole evaluation

## Testing / Integrity

**Date:** 26-Jun-2007  
Formation integrity test performed and accepted.

**Event types identified:**
- pressure test
- integrity confirmation

## What this demonstrates

A reader can understand the well construction and major operational events without reading the original drilling reports.
